h1. EnvironmentFlag

Here goes my first attempt at a plugin... take it easy on me!

Environment flag presents a constant in your face notification for the environment of your display page. 
This came out of necessity as my company is always jumping around from development, staging, demo, and 
production environments. This can get confusing when you have multiple instances of your site open and are 
not sure which environment you're actually looking at. The Environment Flag will display on all environments 
except production.

It's not a lot of work to do manually but after using it on all of my sites... it's nice to finally have it 
available in just a few commands


h2. Example

* Just add this simple tag anywhere in your layout: 
  <pre><code><%= render_environment_flag %></code></pre>
  __I usually prefer directly under the <body> tag.__
* You can also add your own message:
  <pre><code><%= render_environment_flag("Am I really in the #{Rails.env} environment?") %></code></pre>
* Style as necessary.  I have included a basic style example in /example/example.css
